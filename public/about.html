                    <h6 class="mb-4 text-white" data-aos="fade-up">"How to beat Minecraft?"</h6>

                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">In this video, the creator outlines a straightforward approach to beating Minecraft, focusing on three main stages: the Overworld, the Nether, and the End. The video specifically covers the Overworld segment, detailing steps to acquire full diamond armor, tools, and establish an iron farm for gameplay progression.
                        The first step involves gathering resources by punching trees to craft a boat. The creator emphasizes the importance of exploring bodies of water to locate shipwrecks and villages. Shipwrecks provide valuable resources like iron and diamonds, while villages are crucial for future gameplay.
                        Upon finding a village, the player is advised to loot chests for iron and food, then utilize village houses to craft stone tools. These tools will enable the player to defeat an Iron Golem, allowing them to collect iron, which is essential for creating a water bucket and shield—key items for survival.
                        The video introduces two methods to acquire emeralds: building an iron farm and creating a string duper. The iron farm involves setting up a killing chamber for Iron Golems using villagers and zombies, while the string duper allows players to generate infinite string for trading with villagers.
                        Lastly, the creator encourages players to search for a lava pool or ruined portal to gather obsidian for crafting a Nether portal, setting the stage for the next phase of the game.

                    <h6 class="mb-4 text-white" data-aos="fade-up">"What is the best strength build in Elden Ring?”</h6>

                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">The best strength build in Elden Ring emphasizes the use of powerful talismans, weapons, and spells to maximize damage output against various bosses. Key components of this build include the Claw Talisman and Raptor's Feather chest piece, which significantly enhance attack damage, potentially increasing it by over 30%. Players should also consider the S and SAR Talismans and Thor's Cracks tier to optimize damage further.

                        The Lions Claw skill, used with weapons like the Guts' Greatsword, is highlighted as an excellent pairing for maximizing damage, especially against larger enemies. For projectile options, which are limited in strength builds, using spells like the Claw Mark Seal is recommended, alongside the Smithing Shield from the DLC for its effective projectile skill.
                        
                        The Starfist weapon is noted for its fast heavy attacks and stance-breaking capabilities, making it user-friendly for beginners. The build can also incorporate spells such as Catch Flame for fire damage, Roar Regalia for area-of-effect attacks, and Pest Threads for larger bosses. Buff spells are essential for enhancing overall performance in battles.
                        
                        Overall, the strategy involves trading hits with bosses while utilizing a combination of melee attacks and spells. The build is adaptable, allowing for various configurations depending on the player's faith level, with a focus on damage output and versatility.</p>
